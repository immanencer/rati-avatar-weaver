# Project Scratchpad

## Project Summary
NFT Avatar Generation Platform
- Decentralized NFT avatar generation platform on Solana blockchain
- Web3-powered avatar ecosystem with NFT generation capabilities
- Stack: Rust backend, Solana blockchain, React frontend, TypeScript, Express.js API, MongoDB
- Uses: Metaplex NFT standard, Arweave storage, Candy Machine minting protocol

## Current Goal
Optimize Solana minting process with improved block height handling and transaction confirmation strategy

## Current Status (January 11, 2025)

### UMI Migration Progress
- [x] Uninstalled previous Metaplex packages
- [x] Installed UMI 0.8.9 compatible packages
- [x] Updated candyMachine.service.ts to use UMI 0.8.9 API
- [x] Removed mpl-bubblegum dependency (not needed)
- [x] Fixed routes.ts UMI type conversion issues
- [ ] Update solana.routes.ts with proper UMI interfaces
- [ ] Fix remaining type errors in transaction utils
- [ ] Verify transaction processing with new UMI version

### Current Issues

#### 1. UMI Integration
- Native module bindings warning: "Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used"
  - Status: Expected behavior with UMI 0.8.9
  - Impact: Performance only, functionality works
  - Resolution: Continue with pure JS implementation

#### 2. Type Compatibility
Issues identified:
- Incorrect type usage in transaction processing
- Missing proper UMI/Web3.js type conversions
- Need to update interfaces for UMI 0.8.9 compatibility

#### 3. Transaction Processing
Required fixes:
- Update block height validation for UMI 0.8.9
- Enhance transaction splitting logic
- Verify compute budget calculations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix remaining type errors:
   - Update solana.routes.ts interfaces
   - Correct transaction utils type definitions
   - Add proper UMI type imports

2. Verify UMI integration:
   - Test transaction creation
   - Validate block height handling
   - Check compute budget calculation

3. Implement error handling:
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Enhance error recovery
   - Improve transaction retry logic

### Future Improvements
1. Performance Optimization:
   - Fine-tune compute units
   - Optimize priority fees
   - Enhance batch processing

2. Monitoring:
   - Add transaction success metrics
   - Track confirmation times
   - Monitor block height validity

## Notes
- UMI 0.8.9 integration in progress
- Focus on type safety and proper conversions
- Need to verify changes with actual transactions
- Pure JS implementation acceptable for now

## Technical Debt
### Code Organization
1. Utilities Consolidation:
   - Moved common functions to solana.utils.ts
   - Added proper type definitions
   - Need to remove remaining duplicates

2. Error Handling:
   - Added specific error types
   - Enhanced logging
   - Need more comprehensive error recovery

3. Performance:
   - Added retry mechanisms
   - Improved block height validation
   - Need metrics for monitoring

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions
1. Fix native module issue:
   - Review build process
   - Check system dependencies
   - Consider pure JS alternatives

2. Verify Block Height Handling:
   - Test with different network conditions
   - Verify retry mechanisms
   - Add comprehensive logging

3. Clean Up Implementation:
   - Remove duplicate utilities
   - Standardize error handling
   - Add performance monitoring

### Future Improvements
1. Transaction Processing:
   - Optimize batch processing
   - Enhance priority fee calculation
   - Improve error recovery

2. Monitoring:
   - Add transaction success metrics
   - Monitor block height validity
   - Track confirmation times

3. Performance:
   - Optimize retry strategies
   - Enhance connection management
   - Improve error recovery

## Notes to Remember
- Block height validation now properly implemented
- Transaction confirmation strategy enhanced
- Native module issue doesn't affect functionality
- Current focus on stability over performance
- Need to verify changes in production environment

### Error Patterns Observed
1. Native Module Bindings:
   - Error: "Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used"
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Impact: Performance only

2. Block Height Validation:
   - Previous: Inconsistent validation
   - Current: Proper checks implemented
   - Status: Needs production testing

3. Transaction Processing:
   - Previous: Unreliable confirmations
   - Current: Enhanced validation
   - Status: Ready for testing
